# Real-or-Not-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets

# Overview
* Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

* In this competition, the challenge was to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. Access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified was provided. 

## Objective

To predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.

## Columns
1. id - a unique identifier for each tweet
2. text - the text of the tweet
3. location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
4. keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
5. target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)

## Metrics
* F-1 score

## Rank
* 79/1321
